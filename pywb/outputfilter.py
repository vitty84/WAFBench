""" Output filter Process the output of wb.

This exports:
    - OutputFilter is a class, it's an abstract class
        and defines the interfaces.
    - simple_printer is a function that will print lines received by it.
    - HelpDocumentReviser is a class who will revise the help document.

All of option filters will inherit OutputFilter or just
    a simple function whose argument and return value are both string.
    The argument is a line of output of wb, and the return value will be
    passed to next filter.
